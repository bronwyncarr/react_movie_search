# Movie Madness

## â„¹ About

Search for movies by title to see the overview, image and rating.
The application sends a fetch request to [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for information to display

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcome

This aim of this project was to take a vanilla JS app I had previously made and refactor it into a React application. The [original application](https://github.com/bronwyncarr/50_projects_50_days) was created from the movie app in [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) course by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.
